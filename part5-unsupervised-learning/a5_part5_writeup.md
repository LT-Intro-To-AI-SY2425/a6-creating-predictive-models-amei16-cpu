After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
The top left would be crazy poor spender, bottom left would be poor careful spenders, the middle would be normal spenders, top right would be rich ballers, bottom left would be rich savers
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
it would be sort of close to either the middle one or the bottom right one
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
Bottom left group interests me because they spend little and make little and I think a way to approach this customer group would to sell clothing that could be really cheap or like used quality clothing.
