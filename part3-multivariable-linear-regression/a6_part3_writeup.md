# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The R squared coefficient for the model is the independent variable which is miles and age vs the dependent variable which is the price. The closer the number is to 1 the more accurate the 2 datasets are.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
The model is not that accurate because the results are somewhat far from the actual value when printed.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The first car would be worth around $13,000 and the second car would return a negative value so the car would be worthless.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
The car got to a price where it wouldn't sell for anything and sort of like in real life someone wouldn't want to buy the car you are selling because it is both really old and has a lot of miles.
