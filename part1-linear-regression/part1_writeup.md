# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.63 and this tells us how well the independent variable connects to the dependent variable.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is around 137 mm Hg
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think that the model's predictions are accurate to the information it is given and that around say the age of 42 that should be around what an average persons blood pressure should be.
